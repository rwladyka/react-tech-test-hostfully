# React + TypeScript + Ant Design + Redux Toolkit + Vite

a dynamic web application built with a powerful stack that combines React, TypeScript, Ant Design, Redux Toolkit, and Vite. This README provides an overview of the key decisions and technologies driving this project.

## Project Setup

This project is based on the Vite template, offering a minimal setup designed to seamlessly integrate React with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and includes ESLint rules for a clean and consistent codebase.

## Key Decisions

### TypeScript

I've opted for TypeScript to bring static typing to our components. This decision enhances development speed, improves code quality through advanced linting, and provides autocompletion capabilities. TypeScript also ensures compatibility with the latest ECMAScript versions.

### Ant Design

Ant Design was my UI component library of choice. It provides a comprehensive set of high-quality React components out of the box. With excellent TypeScript support, Ant Design aids in creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, contributing to an enhanced user experience.

### Redux Toolkit

Managing global state is streamlined with Redux Toolkit, offering an excellent development experience, especially when paired with TypeScript. By simplifying state management, Redux Toolkit ensures a robust and predictable data flow within our React application.

## Getting Started

To kickstart your journey with this project, follow these steps:

1. Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the Development Server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the development server with HMR, allowing you to see changes in real-time.
